      <div class="statement-rules-content">
        <br>
        During the competition <const>4</const> start-ups will try to get the most market share.<br>
        To sell your software you will have to recruit employees and give them orders.<br>
        The game stands for 100 turns unless a start-up reach 80% market share before<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Chronology</b><br>
        <br>
        Each turn following actions are performed:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Recruitment : increasing or decreasing employees</li>
          <li>Pay : Your cash increases and all employees receive their pay (including new ones)</li>
          <li>Development: new features are developed (and new bugs appear)</li>
          <li>Sales : sellers sell your software, increasing your market share</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Recruitment</b><br>
        <br>
        Your can recruit different types of employees each turn:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers, developing new features and maintaining for your software</li>
          <li>Sellers, selling your software increasing your market share</li>
          <li>Managers, manage other employees so that they perform their task correctly</li>
        </ul>
        There are limitations:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>You can recruit or fire maximum 1 manager each turn</li>
          <li><const>|devsToHire| + |sellersToHire| ≤ 2 × managers</const> where |n| means absolute value of n</li>
          <li><const>employeeCount ≤ 10 × managers</const>. Where employeeCount is your total number of developers and sellers</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Employees affectations</b><br>
        <br>
        Different affectations for your employees:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers : new features <b>or</b> maintenance</li>
          <li>Sellers : unfilled market <b>or</b> try to steal market share from competitors</li>
          <li>Managers  : manage other employees</li>
        </ul>
        To work well, ratio between employees and managers should be <const>1</const> manager per <const>4</const> employees.<br>
        Employees outside this ratio will change their affectation randomly by:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>doing the action you intend to</li>
          <li>doing a different action (devs will switch from features to maintenance, sellers from unfilled market to competitive market)</li>
          <li>doing nothing</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Pay</b><br>
        <br>
        Each turn your cash increases proportionally to your market share. <const>cash = cash + marketShare in thousandth</const><br>
        Employees don't work for free, you will have to pay them each turn:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers : <const>$10</const> for each</li>
          <li>Sellers : <const>$10</const> for each</li>
          <li>Managers : <const>$20</const> for each</li>
        </ul>
        For example: 5 developers, 3 seller, 2 managers will cost 5 × 10 + 3 × 10 + 2 × 20 = $120.<br>
        If you don't have enough cash, your employees will be fired one by one until you have enough money, starting by developers, then sellers, then managers.<br>
        In the previous example, if you had only $100 cash 2 developers would be fired.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Development</b><br>
        <br>
        <const>features</const> developed increase by the number of developers affected to new features<br>
        <const>bugs</const> count decrease by the number of developers affected to maintenance and <const>tests</const> increase by the same number<br>
        New bugs appear. Indeed, for the next <const>9 rounds</const> after a feature has been developed it has a chance to produce a bug<br>
        <const>Pbug(t) = e^(-0.3 × t) × max(0, 1 - 0.25 * tests / features)</const><br>
        You can find at the end a table of 9 first values of e^(-0.3 × t)<br>
        Note: if you have 4 times more tests than features you can't have bugs anymore.<br>
        Note: tests will always increase by maintenance devs count, event if there is no bug.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Reputation</b><br>
        Even fixed, bugs damage your start-up reputation and make harder the work of your sellers.<br>
        Your reputation is calculated by:<br>
        <const>reputation = 100 × features / (existingBugs × 3 + fixedBugs)</const><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sales</b><br>
        <br>
        Market is always growing, all start-ups have their market reducing by 5%.<br>
        <b>Phase 1 - Unfilled market:</b><br>
        Your start-up will get an unfilledMarketScore calculated by:<br>
        <const>unfilledMarketScore = unfilledMarketSellers × reputation × features</const><br>
        Then your market share will increase by <const>availableUnfilledMarket × unfilledMarkerScore / totalUnfilledMarketScore</const><br>
        Where availableUnfilledMarket = min(4% × playerCount, remainingUnfilledMarket)<br>
        <br>
        <b>Phase 2 - Competitive market</b><br>
        Your start-up will get a competitiveMarkerScore calculated by:<br>
        <const>competitiveMarketScore = competitiveMarketSellers × reputation × features</const><br>
        Then all start-ups will fight once in a random order.<br>
        <br>
        Fight example between start-up A and start-up B:<br>
        If reputationA is greater than reputationB<br>
        Then start-up A will steal market share from start-up B calculated by:<br>
        <const>stolenMarketShare = min(0.8%, 0.4% × competitiveMarkerScoreA / competitiveMarkerScoreB)</const><br>
        Optional rule:<br>
        Instead of fighting everyone you can decide to focus on only one competitor in this case stolenMarket will be calculated by:<br>
        <const>stolenMarketShare = (playerCount - 1) × min(0.8%, 0.4% × competitiveMarkerScoreA / competitiveMarkerScoreB)</const><br>
        <br>
