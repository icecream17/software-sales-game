    <div>
      <div class="statement-rules-content">During the competition<const>4</const> start-ups will try to get the most market share.<br>
        To sell your software you will have to recruit employees and give them orders.<br>
        <br>
        Your can recruit different types of employees:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers, developing new features and tests for your software and fixing bugs</li>
          <li>Sellers, selling your software increasing your market share</li>
          <li>Managers, helping you to control other employees so that they perform their task correctly</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div class="title">Pays rules</div>
        Each turn your cash increases proportionally to your market share in thousandth<br>
        Employees don't work for free, you will have to pay them each turn:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers : <const>$10</const> for each</li>
          <li>Sellers : <const>$10</const> for each</li>
          <li>Managers : <const>$20</const> for each</li>
        </ul>
        For example: 5 developers, 3 seller, 2 managers will cost 5 × 10 + 3 × 10 + 2 × 20 = $120.<br>
        If you don't have enough cash your employees will be fired one by one until you have enough money, starting by developers, then sellers, then managers.<br>
        In the previous example if you had only $100 cash 2 developers would be fired.<br>
        <br>
        <div class="title">Employees actions</div>
        Different type of actions can be performed by your employees:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers : they can either work on developing new features either work on fixing existing bugs and developing tests</li>
          <li>Sellers : they can either sell for new client either try to steal clients for other start-ups (harder) </li>
          <li>Managers : manage other employees and determine your recruitment capacity</li>
        </ul>
        But be careful! If you have less than <const>1</const> manager per <const>4</const> employees (developer or seller) they might do something else (A developer that was developing new features might decide by himself to debug instead, or to do nothing!)<br>
        For example if you have 60 employees and 10 managers, 40 employees will follow their order, each of 20 others has:<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>34% chance to do the action you intend to</li>
          <li>33% chance to do a different action</li>
          <li>33% chance to do nothing</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div class="title">Recruitment capacity</div>
        You can recruit or fire <const>1</const> manager each turn, there is no maximum limit<br>
        You can recruit of fire each turn <const>2 × managers</const> developers plus sellers<br>
        You can recruit a total of <const>10 × managers</const> employees in your start-up, excluding managers<br>
        <br>
        <div class="title">Chronologie of a turn</div>
        Each turn following actions are performed:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Recruitment : increasing or decreasing employees</li>
          <li>Pay : Your cash increases and all employees receive their pay (including new ones)</li>
          <li>Development: new features are developed (and new bugs appear)</li>
          <li>Sales : sellers sell your software, increasing your market share</li>
        </ol>

      <action>debugDevs</action> is the number of your developers that will be affected to fixe bugs. By fixing a bug it will reduce the bugs number by 1 <b>and</b> increase tests number by 1. If there is no bug in your software it will just increase tests number by 1.<br>
      Beware tests number can be increased only if a feature already exists or has been developed during the turn<br>
      <action>aggressiveSellers</action> is the number of your sellers that will try to steal market share from other start-up. Note that it is harder to steal market than take it from free market.<br>
